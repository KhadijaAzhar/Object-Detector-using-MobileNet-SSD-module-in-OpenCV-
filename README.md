# Object-Detector-using-MobileNet-SSD-module-in-OpenCV

Object detection, a subset of computer vision, is an automated method for locating interesting objects in an image with respect to the background.

MobileNet SSD and deep neural network (dnn ) module is used in OpenCV to build object detector.

In this Code Pretained model MobileNetSSD_deploy.caffemodel is loaded (MobileNet SSD + deep neural network (dnn ) module) using OpenCV library in Python to build our object detector.
